üñêÔ∏è PROVE: 3D Hand Angles Plotting ‚Äî Right Index Finger Kinematics
This project computes, analyzes, and visualizes the 3D joint angles of the right index finger derived from motion-capture typing data. By extracting MCP abduction, MCP/PIP/DIP flexion, and angular velocity, PROVE (Project for Verification of Kinematic Events) analyzes biomechanical typing patterns to reveal motor intent and keypress identity.

üß† Motivation: Decoding Biomechanical Signatures
Typing generates distinct biomechanical signatures in finger movement. This project investigates whether fine-grained finger-joint kinematics can reliably predict which key is being pressed, opening doors for advanced Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) applications:

üëÅÔ∏è+‚úã Gaze-and-Hand Predictive Typing: Enhancing predictive text models by incorporating sub-conscious finger movements.

üß† Motor-Intention Decoding: Translating pre-press movement into input for control or accessibility.

üï∂Ô∏è VR/AR Natural Text Entry: Developing robust, intuitive input systems for immersive environments.

üî¨ Biomechanics & HCI Research: Advancing the fundamental understanding of human motor control during interaction.

‚ú® Features
Kinematic Extraction: Computation of right-index-finger MCP abduction and MCP/PIP/DIP flexion.

Dynamic Analysis: Calculation of angular velocity (œâ) using angle unwrapping for continuous data.

Event Sampling: Precise sampling of angles and velocities at per-keypress events.

3D Visualization: Plotting of kinematic clusters for y,h,n,u,j,m keys to demonstrate key separation.

High-Throughput Processing: Parallel CSV processing and support for the QTM motion-capture marker format.

üìê Mathematical Methodology
## üìé Kinematic Measures Summary

| Kinematic Measure | Description | Formula |
|------------------|------------|--------|
| **Palm Plane Normal** \( \hat{n} \) | Unit vector perpendicular to the palm plane | $$ \hat{n} = \frac{( \mathbf{p}_2 - \mathbf{p}_1 ) \times ( \mathbf{p}_3 - \mathbf{p}_1 )}{\left\lVert ( \mathbf{p}_2 - \mathbf{p}_1 ) \times ( \mathbf{p}_3 - \mathbf{p}_1 ) \right\rVert} $$ |
| **MCP Abduction Angle** | Signed angle between projected finger direction and reference palm axis | $$ \theta_{\text{abd}} = \text{sign}\!\left((\vec{v}_{ref} \times \vec{v}_{proj}) \cdot \hat{n}\right)\, \cdot \theta $$ |
| **PIP / DIP Flexion** | Angle between adjacent phalanx vectors \( \vec{v}_1 , \vec{v}_2 \) | $$ \theta_{\text{flex}} = \arccos\left(\frac{\vec{v}_1 \cdot \vec{v}_2}{\lVert \vec{v}_1 \rVert \, \lVert \vec{v}_2 \rVert}\right) $$ |
| **Angular Velocity** \( \omega \) | Rate of change of unwrapped joint angle | $$ \omega = \frac{d(\theta_{\text{unwrap}})}{dt} $$ |
