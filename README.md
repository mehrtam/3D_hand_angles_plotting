# 3D_hand_angles_plotting
Computes and visualizes 3D right-index-finger joint angles from motion-capture typing data. Extracts MCP abduction, MCP/PIP/DIP flexion, and angular velocity, then plots 3D kinematic clusters for each keypress. Helps analyze biomechanical patterns in typing for hand-motion decoding and predictive text research.
